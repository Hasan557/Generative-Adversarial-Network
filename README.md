# Generative-Adversarial-Network



### Prerequisites

This lab is conducted using a python library called Tensorflow. 

### Installing

I have used environment of Jupyter notebook to run the file.

### Purpose

(1)	obtain	practical	knowledge	and	hands-on	understanding	of	the	concepts of GAN.

(2) obtain experience on how to implement GAN using tensorflow.

(3) Understand the whole architecture of how GAN uses Discriminator and Generator.

### How the purpose is achieved

Understanding GAN models concept

A) What are 2 basic parts in Generative model i.e Discrimator and Generator?

B) What	is	the	specific	objective	of	these	two	part i.e what does Discrimator and Generator does?

C) What is the basic loss function of GAN? And how optimal solution is achieved?

D) What is training process of basic GAN?
